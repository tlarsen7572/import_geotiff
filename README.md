# Import Geotiff

Import Geotiff is a custom Alteryx tool to import geotiff files. It is designed specifically for the 1 degree x 1 degree geotiff files at 1 arc-second resolution published by the United States Geological Survey (USGS). You can download USGS geotiff files at the [USGS Data Download Application](https://apps.nationalmap.gov/downloader).

This custom tool was designed to provide ground elevation data for the [open source NASR database](https://github.com/tlarsen7572/us_airspace_data).
